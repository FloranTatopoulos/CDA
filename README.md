## Presentation 

My project is called “Architect”, it consists in managing a SMMA (social media marketing agency) communication agency for architects from small companies. I chose this project to validate my certification as an Application Designer and Developer.

## Content 

It will then take the form of a web application, or WebApp, which will be the original version, in other words a collaborative website with a front-end and back-end with a connection and registration form, a contact form and finally a blog where architects will be able to interact with creations of publications in reference to architecture.
It will also be available as a mobile application, which will have the same features as the web application. It will therefore be possible to navigate the application with a cell phone, Android or iOS for example.
Finally, it will also be available as a Desktop App, which will also have the same features as the two previous applications, but with, in bonus, an administrator part. It will therefore be possible to access the platform on an application directly on a computer, under Windows.
All applications will be controlled by a single API.
